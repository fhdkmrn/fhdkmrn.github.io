          <p>With the beginning of the English Premier League and Ligue 1 this past weekend, European soccer is officially in full swing. With so many leagues yet to begin, including La Liga, the Bundlesliga, Serie A, the Champions League, and the Europa League, there is still plenty of time to make predictions for this upcoming season. Some things seem set from the beginning of the season -- PSG will win Ligue 1 and Bayern Munich will win the Bundlesliga. Throughout this post, however, I will give all of my picks for the major European leagues and tournaments, along with various individual accolades in each of the leagues. </p>
          <h4>English Premier League</h4>
          <p><strong>Champion: Liverpool.</strong> Manchester City come into the season at 8/13 odds to win it all, with Liverpool in a distant secomd at 10/2. Manchester United and Spurs haven't bolstered their squad enough in this transfer window to make a serious shot at the title. Arsenal and Chelsea, though having new coaches and a multitude of signings, need more time to show their worth. Picking Liverpool might be unnecessarily ambitious and brave, but their off-season additions strengthen every position that hurt them last season. In particular, Alisson is a major upgrade over both Karius and Mignolet, Naby Keita provides a strong and composed presence in the middle of the field, and Shaqiri and Fabinho provide some depth that Liverpool sorely lacked last season. Manchester City, meanwhile, got Benjamin Mendy back from injury which allows them to play a fluid 5 to 3 at the back, and purchased Riyad Mahrez for a record fee. In all honestly, the Mahrez purchase might just add more difficulty for Pep in his team selection, but does provide some nice options of the bench in any game. Everyone, including Klopp, knows how City play, and Liverpool showed how a high-press was able to thwart City on multiple occasions. As the front line of Liverpool remain unstoppable, and as they play a unique style of football, most teams won't know how to deal with them most season. It will be a close race, but I see Liverpool ending their long English drought.</p>
          <p><strong>Top Scorer: Lukaku.</strong> This award is always difficult, as there is always some new player who has a breakout season. I pick Lukaku for this award, as I see Pogba and Lukaku linking up well after a fabulous world cup campaign. Lukaku last season had, by his standards, a poor season but still ended it with 16 goals. Look for Lukaku to propel Manchester United to a champions league spot, likely 3rd, and carrying the bulk of the goals for the team.</p>
          <p><strong>PFA Player of the Year: Firmino.</strong> The Brazilian is often overlooked in the team due to the fact that Mo Salah has stolen most of the headlines. Firmino, however, both on the ball and off the ball, is one of Liverpool's brighest sparks in each and every game. Firmino is coming off a torid world cup, in which he barely got a starting place, but his magic in scoring, assisting, and plays off the ball will help propel Liverpool to the title.</p>

          <h4>Serie A</h4>
          <p><strong>Champion: Juventus.</strong> This one should be pretty self-explanatory -- Juventus have had a strongold on the competition for years now. With the addition of Ronaldo and Bonnucci, Juventus have no obvious weak links and will dispatch of most of its domestic competitors with ease.</p>
          <p><strong>Top Scorer: Ronaldo.</strong> Cristiano Ronaldo over the years has transitioned from a traditional winger to a more central goal scorer. Though this limits his creativity, it causes his goal tally to hit extraordinarily high marks each and every season. As he hits 33, he remains in top physical form and looks like he is not slowing down any time soon. </p>
          <p><strong>Serie A Footballer of the Year: Ronaldo.</strong> Ronaldo will take Serie A by storm, and liven it to become a more relevant league than it has been in past years. Through this, and his amazing goal scoring record, Ronaldo will easily show that he is the best player in Serie A.</p>

          <h4>Bundesliga</h4>
          <p><strong>Champion: Bayern Munich.</strong> Bayern Munich has no real competition in the Bundesliga, and have won it early almost every year. This season will be no different.</p>
          <p><strong>Top Scorer: Lewandowski.</strong> Transfer rumors for Lewandowsi were at an all time high this past summer, partially due to an awful World Cup campaign which saw Poland crash out in last place at the group stage. He looks angry and needs to prove that he can be an assett to another team so that he may be transferred out of the German champions sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p><strong>Footballer of the Year in Germany: Joshua Kimmich.</strong> This award can be won by either a German abroad of a foreigner in Germany, but Joshua Kimmich is a German footballer playing for the most pretigious German club. Kimmich has impressed for Bayern all of last year, and expect the 23 year old full-back to keep impressing and make a bigger name for himself this season.</p>

          <h4>La Liga</h4>
          <p><strong>Champion: Barcelona.</strong> As a Madrid fan, this one pains but, it is unfortunately true. Barcelona are experts at the league, and their main competitors, Real Madrid, have lost the most important player in their history as of recent. Athletico Madrid, however, present a bigger threat to the blaugrana, as they have kept Griezmann and addded Thomas Lemar to their squad. If Athletico Madrid can finish off the smaller teams, they can push Barcelona for the title far into the season.</p>
          <p><strong>Top Scorer: Griezmann.</strong> Messi, Suarez, Coutinho, Malcolm, and Dembele will be sharing the goals for Barcelona, while Griezmann is coming off of an amazing World Cup and is the focal point of Athletico Madrid's attack. If Athletico Madrid can push Barcelona for the title, it will be because the French attacker and his goal scoring accolades.</p>


          <h4>UEFA Champions League</h4>
          <p><strong>Champion: Juventus.</strong> Maybe I am jumping the gun, but the fact that Juventus has been so close for the last few seasons makes me believe that the addition of Ronaldo will be enough to put them over the line. The last two seasons, their run was ruined in the final and the quarter-finals by the eventual champions Real Madrid, and specifically, Cristiano Ronaldo. They have too much talent, and with a true goal scorer who doesn't squander many opportunities (unlike their past striker Higuain), Juventus has all the tools necessary to finally win the prestigious cup..</p>
          <p><strong>Top Scorer: Ronaldo.</strong> With players like Pjanic, Dybala, and Douglas Costa providing him with the deliveries, Ronaldo will sweep away the goal scoring competition in the Champions League as he has in so many recent seasons.</p>

          <h4>UEFA Europa League</h4>
          <p><strong>Champion: Chelsea.</strong> Chelsea retained much of their attacking line, and have a frightening midfield of Kovacic, Kante, and Jorginho. With the Europa League not starting until later in the season, the team will be much more accustomed to Sarri-ball and will prove too much for others in the Europa League.</p>
          <p><strong>Top Scorer: Immobile.</strong> Lazio will likely make it to the semi-finals or quarter-finals, and Immobile's goal-scoring record will propel them to such a level. He is coming off a fresh rest this past summer and will be looking to replicate his scoring record from last season in both Serie A and the Europa League.</p>

          <h4>Individual Awards</h4>
          <p><strong>Ballon d'Or:: Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong> Luka Modric is coming in off a hot streak at the World Cup, but Cristiano is just too far ahead due to his season with Real Madrid. He propelled them to a third champions league in the row, and even though Modric was a big part of it, Cristiano is the poster boy of the champions league. If (I should really say when) Ronaldo hits the ground running at Juventus, he will runaway with the vote for the Ballon d'Or, most likely for the last time in his star-studded career.</p>
