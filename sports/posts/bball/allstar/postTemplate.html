        <div class="w3-justify">
          <p>The NBA season is roughly half-way complete, and we have already had some fascinating story lines. From James Harden's extraordinary record breaking run, to the Denver Nuggets competing atop of the Western Conference, there are some phenomenon no one could have predicted. As tradition every year, the fan voting for the All-Star game is open and in full-swing. This year it is easier than ever. With just a google search of any player or any team, you can submit your All-Star starting line-up right from Google! The second returns of fan voting are in, and there are definitely some surprises. Rookie Luka Doncic sits 2nd in the Western Conference front-court rankings, while Dwayne Wade sits 2nd in Eastern guard voting during his One Last Dance season. Combined with Boogie Cousins receiving votes while being out injured all game, we should all be thankful that fan voting is just a part of the final decision for who makes the All-Star game. With that all being said, I have spent a lot of time watching game clips and scouring box scores to come up with an informed starting line-up for the All-Star game this year in Charlotte. This year, the ballot is divided into 2 guards and 3 frontcourt personnel per conference, making the fan decisions harder than ever. I try my best in this article to justify my reasonings for each player in my starting line-up. Without further ado, let's get started. </p>
          <h4>Eastern Conference</h4>
          <h5>Guards</h5>
          <h6>Starters</h6>
          <p><strong>Kyrie Irving</strong>. Not too many people should be surprised by this one. Kyrie Irving is single handedly keeping the Celtics ship floating with 22.7 points per game, and a 3-point shooting percentage of 39.7%. This puts him at 16th and 27th in those two positions respectively. Though this might not see like a lot for a star like Kyrie, it is important to note that he is often sharing the court with players who believe they could be the main asset of any other team and, hence, want the ball in their hands. He is making the team around him better, as well, averaging 6.4 assists per game, putting him in 12th in the NBA. His impressive work on the offensive side of the ball is making up for the sophomore slumps of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, as well as the misfiring introduction of Gordon Hayward. If you need any more convincing that Kyrie deserves to be here, just see how the 5th-ranked Celtics fare when Rozier is out on the floor with Kyrie on the bench. Rozier boasts a +4, while Kyrie Irving has team high +261. Kyrie Irving is the Celtics main power, and still remains one of the best guards in the NBA. </p>
          <p> <strong>Kemba Walker</strong>. How fitting is it that, in the year the All-Star game is hosted in Charlotte, the Hornet's own Kemba Walker is making a strong case for being a starting guard. He is leading his team to the cusp of a playoffs spot, granted, it is in the torrid Eastern Conference. Nevertheless, he gets 25.2 points per game, which puts him at 12th place in the NBA. He has the ability any night to go off for over 40 points and have a general explosive talent that most guards in the Eastern Conference are missing. Much like Kyrie, he gets others involved and sits at 20th in the NBA in assists per game, with 5.7 per game. Ontop of all of this, he's averaging over a steal a game and is constantly linked to many teams who are one piece away from competing for a title this year. Kemba should get ready to suit up for the prestigious game in his own home stadium. </p>
          <h6>Honorable Mentions</h6>
          <p><strong>Victor Oladipo</string> is putting up impressive numbers for the 3rd-ranked Pacers, though he is still suffering from an overall decline from last year. He has missed a large amount of time due to injury, which also affects his positioning in the race for the starting guard. Oladipo's playing decent defense and averaging 19.5 points per game and 5.2 assists, which are impressive, but not as good as the two starters ahead of him. </p>

          <h5>Frontcourt</h5>
          <h6>Starters</h6>
          <p><strong>Giannis Antentekounmpo</strong>. This is one of the most obvious decisions that should be on everyones ballots. The Greek Freak's numbers this year for the 2nd place Bucks are astounding. He is averaging 26.4 points a game on 57.8% shooting, with 12.6 rebounds and 6.0 assists. On top of these impressive offensive numbers, he has been resilient on defense with 1.5 blocks and 1.3 steals a game. He is a legitamite MVP candidate and is the star player and a truly title-contending team. He is putting up historic numbers in the paint, domination which we have not seen until Shaq. His NBA transformation has been incredible, and it has shown in the court.</p>
          <p> <strong>Kawhi Leonard</strong>. Another obvious decision, but Kawhi, despite missing a decent amount of games with injury, leads his Raptors to the top of the Eastern Conference. He averages 27.5 points per games, 8 rebounds, 3.2 assists, while being as potent of a defender as he was before his injury kept him out last season. He's averaging 1.9 steals a game while consistenly defending the opponents best attacking player. He shut down Kevin Durant in a recent Raptors-Warriors game which showed the Raptors are here to contend. Everyone marked Kawhi as a potential MVP candidate, and he has lived up to that billing in his first 35 games.</p>
          <p><strong>Joel Embiid</string>. Much like Giannis, Joel Embiid is putting up impressive big man numbers, but also has a respectable 3 point shot that allows him to stretch the floor and make space for his teammates as well as his own desire to drive in. He boasts a averages a double double with 26.9 points and 13.3 rebounds a game, while consistently getting multiple blocks a game to help out on the defensive end. He is averaging roughly 30% from 3 point range which, though it is a drop-off from last season, is a very respectable number for a big man who shoots consistently from beyond the arch. Embiid's biggest concern before the season was his ability to stay healthy and sustain a high level of play, and he has silenced those fears by starting 41 games and averaging 33.7 minutes a game. Though he might be unhappy with how the team is opperating with Butler and Simmons around him, he can't deny the historic season he is having that puts him definitively in the top 5 in the MVP race.</p>
          <h6>Honorable Mentions</h6>
          <p><strong>Nikola Vucevic</string> started off the season electric, leading the Orlando Magic to a home-court advantage team in the Eastern Conference while consistently scoring over 30 a night and averaging a double-double. Unfortunately, he has cooled off and the magic have regressed back to their expected performance and remain outside of the playoff picture. He stilla verages animpressive 20.1 pointsand 11.9 rebounds a game, but he has remained a bit roe inconsistent in his great performances, as well as his 3 point shooting which proved an important asset in his fiery start. </p>


          <h4>Western Conference</h4>
          <h5>Guards</h5>
          <h6>Starters</h6>
          <p><strong>Steph Curry</strong>. Despite having been injured for part of the season and having only played 33 games, Curry is making a case for winning another league MVP. He has kept his shooting percentages high, even for his standards, while posting 29.5 points per game, putting him at 2nd place in the NBA. His 3 point shooting is as good as ever, shooting a career high 45.6% from beyond the arch. Along with averaging roughly 5 rebounds and 5 assists a game, Curry's inclusion in the starting line-up should be no surprise. What's perhaps most telling of why he deserves to be here is the Warriors stretch when he was injured. Even with Durant and Klay on the court, the Warriors found themselves giving up their impressive 11-2 start and losing consecutive games in convincing fashion. Curry's allows other players to get more involved and opens up opportunities for others beyond the arch, especially Klay Thompson. Klay's numbers without Curry were dreadful, while Curry does not suffer the same way without Klay's presence. He is pivotal to the star-studded Warriors, and there's no doubt this is Curry's team who sits atop of the Western Conference Standings.</p>
          <p> <strong>James Harden</strong>. What James Harden is doing this season is unprecdented, historic, and in all honestly, absolutely crazy. Harden leads the NBA in scoring with a crazy 34.8 points per game, while also having an impressive 8.6 assists per game. He is carrying the load of the team without CP3 and now Clint Capela, and he has singlehandedly brought life back to the Rockets. They have surged from being as low as 13th in the West to being in contention for home-court advantage in the playoffs, all while being the only star on his team. He has more ISO plays than any other NBA team, and there is a good reason for it. Harden has carried the Rockets to a 14-4 record in their last 18 games, all while scoring over 30 points a game in every game for over a month. This is the longest 30-point streak of any player in the NBA since 1976. The reigning MVP definitely has his sights on a back-to-back individual award, while hoping he can keep this streak up and through the playoffs. </p>
          <h6>Honorable Mentions</h6>
          <p><strong>Russell Westbrook</string>, as we are accustomed to, is averaging a triple double and has helped his OKC Thunder to 3rd place in the Western Conference. What is more impressive this season is his committment to the defensive side of the ball, which has helped the Thunder become one of the top defensive teams in the NBA. Unfortunately, however, he is having one of the worst shooting seasons of his career, something he needs to fix if he wants to lead the Thunder to a legitamate shot at the Western Conference title.</p>


          <h5>Frontcourt</h5>
          <h6>Starters</h6>
          <p><strong>Paul George</strong>. Paul George has taken over the Thunder and made them his own team. His decision to stay at OKC instead of moving to the Lakers seems like it is paying dividends, as he has inspired the team with his 26.6 points per game and 2.26 steals a game, along with 8.1 rebounds a game. He has effectively taken over the team from Westbrook and has inspired his teammates to be one of the best defensive units in the NBA. Paul George is a legitamate candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, all while shooting a high 38.4% from three. Paul George is having an impressive season, even for his lofty standards, and deserves true recognition. </p>
          <p> <strong>Kevin Durant</strong>. Despite not being able to lead the Warriors through Curry's injury, Durant continues to put up impressive numbers on the offensive side of the ball. He ranks 4th in the NBA with 28.2 points per game and a career high 6.1 assists a game. Moreover, he is shooting 51% from the court and continues to dominate as one of basketball's best offensive players and scorers of all time. He can spot-up effortlessly from three while also getting his team involved by stretching the floor, driving in, and having an incredible court vision and basketball IQ in order to know what plays to make. Kevin Durant has a strong CV to once again make the All-Star lineup.</p>
          <p><strong>LeBron James</string>. This is definitely the most controversial choice on the list, and that's the first time in the last 15 years I would have to say such a thing. LeBron still averages a 6th-best 27.3 points per game, 10th-best 7.1 assists per game, and an impressive 8.3 rebounds per game. The biggest knock against the King is the fact that he has missed the most recent 11 games with a groin injury. Curry has missed the same number of games, though his position is much less contested then LeBron's. The biggest thing that compels me to pick LeBron over anyone else is how important he was to the Lakers. Without LeBron, the Lakers have dropped from 4th place in the Western Conference to 9th. In just 11 games, the Lakers without LeBron have gone from a home-court advantage team to being out of the playoffs if they started today. LeBron's numbers have been pivotal to the success of a likely playoff team, and they will continue to be when he returns from injury. People not putting LeBron into their All-Star lineups are being affected too much by recency bias, and are forgetting the extraordinary thing he did for the lakers throughout the months of November and December. His statistics speak for themselves, and his role for the team is evident. LeBron deserves to be a starting All-Star once again, and for the first time, in the Western Conference.</p>
          <h6>Honorable Mentions</h6>
          <p><strong>Anthony Davis</string> has put up staggering numbers. He is 3rd in the NBA in scoring with 29.4 points per game, and 3rd in the NBA with 13.3 assists per game. Despite this, however, his Pelicans sit just around 50% wins and Davis isn't able to inspire them to wins. He is doing what he can, but the fact that his team can't perform really hurts his chances at being an All-Star starter. His starting teammates are quality, including Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle, and they really should be performing at a much higher level. Though Davis' numbers are extraordinary, his competition are leading their team to the playoffs while the Pelicans just can't get consistent enough to win.</p>
          <p><strong>Nikola Jokic</string> is the person on this list I feel the worst leaving out. The Joker is having a career season at 23 years young. He is the sole star in the over-achieving 2nd place Denver Nuggets, leading them in points with 19.7 per game, rebounds with 10.1 per game, and assists with 7.5 per game. In particular, His assists are absolutely spectacular. If you haven't seen his insane assists against the Raptors roughly a month ago, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wam4p44KwOo>you should do that right now</a>. His court vision ranks as one of the best in the NBA, and he gets his teammates around him action while stretching the floor with respectable shooting all around the court. This is all while averaging 1.3 steals per game as well. The only thing keeping him out of the starting line-up is the fact that he is in the same conference and position as two of the top 15 players in NBA History, and the likely Defensive Player of the Year.</p>
          <p><strong>Luka Doncic</string> is having a rookie season we haven't seen since LeBron James. Fine, he probably doesn't deserve to be an All-Star just yet with his roughly 20.2 points per game, along with 6.7 rebounds and 5 assists, but I just had to put him on this list. He looks like a future MVP and maybe an all time great. He's even making the Mavs semi-competitive for a playoff spot. Who coudl have ever predicted that!</p>
