  <p>TLDR is a google-chrome extension which summarizes the higlighted portion of a web-page. A group of four friends and I completed this project at Cal Hacks 2.0.I was primarily concerned with the algorithm which created the summary. The project was done in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

  <p>I created my personal website and hosted it on Github. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and more specifically, Bootstrap and JQuery. I made the website primarily to host practice problems for the classes I have taught, including CS70, CS61A, and CS C8, but also to display myself and what I am about in more than just a resume. </p>

  <div class="scripts">
  <img src="scripts.png" class="img-responsive" id="py"> 
  <p>I have written various small python scripts including: a script to create valid secret santa pairs and email their assignment to everyone, a script which downloads the youtube history of a user and stores it in a text file, and a script which downloads youtube videos. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="git">
  <img src="gitlet.png" class="img-responsive" id="git"> 
  <p>I created a small version of Git, aptly named Gitlet, in Java with many working features such as commit, merge, checkout, branch, and many more. Later on, I did a similar thing in C named beargit, with similar working features. </p>
